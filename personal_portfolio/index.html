      <p>In October of 2014, shortly after the death of her father, Kim decided to enter the “tech” space. At the time, she really had no idea what that meant except that she had just gone through her worst fear, caring for a dying parent, and she wasn’t afraid to explore what was possible. Kim spent about 6 months just going to conferences and Meetups to figure out what this tech thing was and it wasn’t long before she realized that in order to really understand, she would have to learn to speak the language.</p>
      <p>Since starting her coding journey, Kim has discovered that it's really not what you code, what language you choose to code in or what path you take to learn, the true value of a great programmer is their ability to solve problems. <br>So that's what she has become...A Problem Solver!</p>
      <p>Kim has years of experience working with learners of all ages, skill level, and abilities and she would like to offer what she knows about successful mentorship to her new community. She is the co-organizer of CodeNewbie-Atlanta, founder of JrDevMentoring and the author of the "Tech Talk For Non-Techies" blog. Kim is also currently pursuing a Doctors of Business Administration - Technology Entrepreneurship. Her doctoral study topic is: “Strategies some software development managers use to effectively mentor junior software developers.” Kim is also working on her passion project JrDevMentoring.com and #MentoringMinute</p>
